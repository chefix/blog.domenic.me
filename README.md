# blog.domenic.me source

To do local watch:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Now open up http://localhost:4000/
```

To do a deploy: not figured out yet.

## TODOs to regain parity with live Octopress 2 version:

- Subtitle on top of site instead of in footer, maybe?
- Front page, including pagination maybe, or at least some archives
- Recent posts sidebar, maybe?
- Site search, maybe?
- Author name in post pages, maybe?
